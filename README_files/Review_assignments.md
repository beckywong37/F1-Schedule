1. Assignment 1
Since this was the first html website in this course, there are many aspects that can be improved upon. Adding in CSS can immediately add more aesthetic and design, just as background color, fonts, positioning, etc. The lack of responsive design makes aspects of the website, like the fixed width images, not suitable for smaller screens. Some things I do like is the image and embedded video, which give some style and color to the webpage. 
2. Assignment 2
This webpage builds off the html skeleton from assignment 1. The inclusion of CSS styling improves the visual appeal of the guide. The layout is well structured with clear headers which has a background color and different font to make it stand out more. I also used text-align to position some of the text in the middle of the website, instead of to the left, which helps make it more visually appealing. 
3. Assignment 3
I really liked the aesthetic of this webpage. The black background with the F1 Logo at the top left corner and the horizontal nagivation bar gave a sleek and minimalistic style. It is also interactive as the user can hover over the F1 team and see a dropdown displaying the drivers. This helps organize the information in a compact and accessibly way without overloading the user. Adding in the viewport tag was also great for responsiveness.
4. Assignment 4
In this webpage, I used bootstrap for styling components such as the buttons, horizontal navigation bar, and the dropdown menu for selecting races, which gives it a fresher and more modern look. This webpage is also alot more interactive, allowing users to select a race and to show race details and the race track. All the logic for retrieving race details and track image is done with javascript, which creates instances of GrandPrixs and has two functions: showRaceDetails and showRaceTrack. I also really how the bright colors of the track image constrast with the black background.
5. Assignment 5
Aesthetically this webpage is similar to assignment 4. The main difference is refactoring assignment 4 to server-side processing with Flask. Whereas, in assignment 4, it was client-side processing using Javascript and HTML. Instead of javascript handling requests, flask is responsible for handling request from the user (such as showing race details and race track image) and sending back responses.
