List of 5 Websites

1. Spotify - https://open.spotify.com/?
I still like the overall layout of the website, where there are 4 main widgets. This helps organize and declutter all the information on the screen. Now taken web development, I appreciate the responsive website layout in which to ensure the layout adjusts smoothly to different screen sizes and devices. However, I notice it is only the main content area and play buttons at the bottom that adapts to resizing, all other widgets remain mostly the same. While the main aim with a responsive website layout is to maintain usability and functionality across various devices, I love when there are design changes incorporated!

2. Amazon - https://www.amazon.com/
Now looking at amazon, I still think it is information overload, there are so many categories of suggestions (Pick up where you left off, Buy again, Categories to explore, etc). I counted 21 of these categories and 3 ads on my home page. I don't like how cluttered it is. However, I can appreciate all that is happening behind the scenes to make this happen. These categories of suggestions are probably tailored to me based on previous searches and AI. The search bar at the top of the screen allows users to find products quickly by typing in key words. It uses server side scripting, processing the user's input into the search bar and populating products that match the user's inputs from their huge database of products. There are also many dropdown menus, some where you simply hover over the tab and others where you actually have to physically click the tab. 

3. Canvas - https://canvas.oregonstate.ed
I love the minimalistic and sleek design of canvas. The one feature I can appreciate the most is the responsive web design. When the webpage is shrunk, the vertical banner on the left hand side disappeares, allowing the user to focus only on the content (ie, readings in the modules). It reduces clutter and distractions, and allows users to allocate more screen space to focus on the task at hand. This is especially helpful when using the split screen feature on mac and screen space is already limited. And if you need to nagivate to a different page on canvas, on the top of the page is two dropdown menus (one in a hamburger bun style and another is an arrow icon) that has all the links the vertical banner has, so functionality is not lost even at different browser sizes.

4. Github - https://github.com
I like the simplicity of Github through their minimalist interface and dark background color. They use collapsed containers to ensure content is displayed correctly and no content is hidden or overflowed. They use a combination of horizontal nagivation bars and a few dropdown vertical lists, which allows users to navigate to different parts of the website.  

5. ChatGPT - https://chat.openai.com/
I like the sleek design of chatgpt. It has a black background, constrasted with the white text, which helps with readability. Like the canvas.edu website, it utilizies responsive webpage design to hide the banner that includes history of searches/conversertions when the webpage is shrunk. This helps to declutter the webpage and allocate more screen page to focus on the content. It also uses server-side scripting, receiving user input, processing it, and delivering dynamically generated content back to the users.
